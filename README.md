# openApi-Center-Front

FrontEnd for the OpenAPI Center App

It's a standard Angular App. It uses Angular-cli. Therefore, common commands are available, like:
 
> ng serve

> ng build

### Integration

It calls the backend through REST calls.  
The base paths for the backend are on `app.config.ts`.   

### TODO

* Use angular-material in some more parts
* Work on tests
* Review styles and colors

Or you can also use it from `npm`. Check the scripts out on `package.json`.
